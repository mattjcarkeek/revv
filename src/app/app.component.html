    <h2>The Revv 107.3 FM</h2>
    <p>"15th September 2004 The Revv 107.3FM muscled it's way onto the Manawatu airwaves. Inspired by the shoestring pirates as well as the Axeman Paul Martin, before a vision was made reality by legend Jeremy Matthews. We ventured to parts unknown and just rode the wave from there.</p>
    <p>Our contribution to the NZ Metal scene cannot be understated. From 2004-2008 we attended over 120 shows, travelled over 170 hours around NZ covering over 12,000km, were live on air for over 28,000hrs across 1,186 days give or take a few hours for breakdowns.</p>
    <p>We played more NZ metal per day than any radio station ever at the time. Were lucky to interview and party with bands from all over NZ as well as Australia, Austria, Denmark and L.A.</p>
    <p>A special shout out to all New Zealand metal bands over the years - we've seen hundreds before our eyes, the ones before us and the ones to come. The scene is so special to be a part of & I'm glad we played our small part.</p>
    <p>Shout out to The Royal Hotel for putting up with us over those years. It was a great relationship</p>
    <p>It was an honour and a credit to us for what we put into the scene. With a good crew that made it run - Special shoutout to those who joined the party Ryan Cooksley, Matt Carkeek, Jamie Baty, Tony Blenkiron, Keir Scott, Terrence McIntosh, Corey Dunweg and the many others that were a cog in our machine. Memories that will last a lifetime." - James Freeman</p>
